# pattern_recognition
This repository contains various jupyter pages written by me working on the MNIST datasets for my course Pattern Recognition. It uses different learning methods such as Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Generative Models, Probabilistic Graphic Models and Linear Discriminant functions. It uses keras and tensorflow for most of the codes.
